# Emotion Detection App

## Description
This repository contains the code for a Streamlit-based web application that detects emotions in text. The app uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning models to classify text into different emotional categories such as "Farxad" (Happiness) and "Murug" (Sadness). The project is implemented using Python and various data science libraries.

## Features
- **Text Emotion Detection**: Classifies input text into emotional categories.
- **Word Cloud Visualization**: Generates word clouds for each emotional category to visually represent common words.
- **Model Performance**: Displays the accuracy of different machine learning models used in the app, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).
- **Interactive Input**: Allows users to input text and see the predicted emotion in real-time.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **Streamlit**: Framework used for building the interactive web application.
- **NLTK**: Library for natural language processing tasks.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for training and evaluating models.
- **Matplotlib**: Library for creating visualizations like word clouds.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
